    \class CaptureDevice
    \brief CaptureDevice is the base class of all capture devices.

    \ingroup Device

    The CaptureDevice class provides the interface to the Capture functionality
    of the Device. Capture functionality means being able to sample
    digital and/or analog signals at a given sample rate.

    A sample rate from this list may be selected by the user when starting
    a capture. Although the selected sample rate is in the returned list a
    capture can still fail, for example, because the specific configuration
    of number of digital and analog signals cannot be sampled at the given
    rate. If the capture fails this should be reported through the
    captureFinished signal.

    This virtual function is called prior to calling start() and can be used

    the capture. Typically a dialog window using \a parent as UI context can
    be shown if additional settings are required.

    virtual function must be overriden in a subclass. Default trigger settings
    can be found in DigitalSignal and AnalogSignal and are typically; trigger
    at high-low transition or low-high transition for a specific signal.

    A dialog window can be presented to the user by using \a parent as Ui
    context.

    Reimplement this function in a CaptureDevice subclass. By default a message
    dialog is shown to indicate that there isn't any additional trigger settings
    for the device.

    \fn virtual void CaptureDevice::calibrate(QWidget* parent)

    If a capture device supports calibration this

    context.

    Start capturing signals at the sample rate given by \a sampleRate.

    The signal captureFinished() must be emitted when a capture
    request has finished or if an error occured.

    Implement this function in a CaptureDevice subclass to start the
    capture. The capture device should only capture signals added by
    addDialogSignal or addAnalogSignal and use the configurations
    (for example trigger settings) set in those container classes
    (DigitalSignal, AnalogSignal).
